Data Sets:

*   Data Sets were acquired from the Mushroom Data Set 2020 published by Phillpps Universitat Marburg in Germany
by Dennis Wagner, Dominik Heiderm and Georges Hattab. 
*   Source Link: https://mushroom.mathematik.uni-marburg.de/
*   Primary Data Set: 
        The primary data set contains descriptions of 173 mushroom species as entries. 
        It can be used to simulate hypothetical mushrooms.
*   Secondary Data Set:
         The secondary data set is a product of such simulation and contains 61,069 hypothetical mushrooms. 
         It can be used for binary classification.
